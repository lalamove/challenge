# Software Engineer Challenge (Frontend)

Build web interface for [backend challenge API](backend.md):

**Solution requirements:**

 - Get start location and drop-off locations from user. Submit them to [API](backend.md)
 - Draw **driving route** returned by API on embedded [map](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
 - API usage should be correct (according to the spec defined for [backend challenge](backend.md))
 - Must be a single-page application (SPA)
 - You are free to make your own API mock or use our [mockApi](mockApi)
 - Source code must be stored in a git repository (you can send it as github or bitbucket link, dropbox/google drive public folder, etc. **NOTE: email servers will reject .zip files with source code**)
 - For public repos avoid words `lalamove` and `challenge` to prevent other candidates from finding your solution
 - There is no specific requirements regarding documentation, architecture, etc. but **we expect your solution to be production ready**

**Questions? We love to answer: <techchallenge@lalamove.com>**
