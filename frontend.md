### Mock API
Our MockAPI (backend) can be accessed though [https://mock-api.dev.lalamove.com](https://mock-api.dev.lalamove.com),
where you can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/lalamove/challenge/blob/master/mockApi/DOC.md).  
Alternatively, you can also boot up [Mock API](https://github.com/lalamove/challenge/tree/master/mockApi).
However, please do not include any part of the Mock API in your submission.
​
## Submission
### **!!!!Important!!!!**
If you submit as a public git repository:
- `Avoid words like “Lalamove” and “challenge” in your repository.`
- `Do not copy any part of this file or any part of the Mock API.`  

Alternatively, you may also send us a ZIP archive file containing your solution. For fairness’ sake, you must also use Git and include the `.git` directory in the archive if you submit a ZIP archive file.

If you are so inclined, you can deploy the application onto a remote server (e.g. heroku) in addition to sending us your Git repository.
