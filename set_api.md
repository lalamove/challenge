# Software Engineer in Test Challenge (API)

## Introduction

In Lalamove, our backend system is composed of a bunch of microservices. These microservices provide RESTful API for each part of the system. We need a series of automated tests to protect our APIs against bugs.

## Requirement

1. We value a **clean**, **simple** working solution.
2. You should provide some simple steps or scripts to run your tests.
3. Candidate must submit the project as a git repository (github.com, bitbucket.com, gitlab.com). Repository must avoid containing words `lalamove` and `challenge`.

## Problem Statement

We have APIs to process orders and require you to make sure it's functioning correctly with black box testing. The API does these tasks:
1. Place Order
2. Fetch Order Details
3. Driver to Take the Order
4. Driver to Complete the Order
5. Cancel Order

## Order Flow

An order has these statuses in sequence: `ASSIGNING` => `ONGOING` => `COMPLETED` or `CANCELLED`
   - `ASSIGNING`: looking for a driver to be assigned
   - `ONGOING`: a driver has been assigned and working on the order
   - `COMPLETED`: the driver has completed the order
   - `CANCELLED`: the order was cancelled

    ONGOING-->COMPLETED;
    ONGOING-->CANCELLED;
```

## Endpoints

### Place Order endpoint
- Endpoint: /v1/orders
- HTTP verb: POST
```JSON
JSON Payload:
{
    "stops": [
        {
            "lat": 22.344674, "lng": 114.124651
        },
        {
            "lat": 22.375384, "lng": 114.182446
        },
        {
            "lat": 22.385669, "lng": 114.186962
        },
        ...
    ]
}
JSON Payload (when you want to place an advance order, set "orderAt" time in future):
{
    "orderAt": "2018-09-03T13:00:00.000Z",
    "stops": [
        {
            "lat": 22.344674, "lng": 114.124651
        },
        {
            "lat": 22.375384, "lng": 114.182446
        },
        {
            "lat": 22.385669, "lng": 114.186962
        },
        ...
    ]
}
Returns: HTTP 201
{
    "id": 1234,
    "drivingDistancesInMeters": [ 2300, 1640, ... ],
    "fare": {
        "amount": "130.00",
        "currency": "HKD"
    }
}
```
1. Return HTTP 201 (Created) with JSON body containing:
   - The order's “id”
   - The driving distances between each 2 stops, in meters. Accuracy below meters is not needed. For example, if there are 3 stops, there will be 2 driving distances.
   - Total fare of the entire trip. It is calculated based on the total trip distance. Price will be calculated based using:
     1. HKD 20 for first 2 kilometers (from 9pm ~ 5am, it will be HKD 30)
     2. After 2 kilometers, each 200-meter costs HKD 5 (from 9pm ~ 5am, it will be HKD 8)

### Fetch Order Details endpoint
- Endpoint: /v1/orders/{orderID}
- HTTP verb: GET
```JSON
JSON Payload: <Empty>
Returns: HTTP 200
{
    "id": 1234,
    "stops": [
        {
            "lat": 22.344674, "lng": 114.124651
        },

## How to run the above API on your local machine

1. You will need to have docker installed (reference: https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. Assuming you are under MacOS, type the following commands (It will be very similar on Linux/Unix OS(es)):
```BASH
$ docker network create lalamove-sample-api || true
$ docker rm -f lalamove-sample-api-db
$ docker run -d --net=lalamove-sample-api --name lalamove-sample-api-db lalamove/lalamove-sample-api-db:1.0
$ docker rm -f lalamove-sample-api
$ docker run -d --net=lalamove-sample-api --name lalamove-sample-api -p 51544:8000 lalamove/lalamove-sample-api:1.0
$ curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" http://localhost:51544/ping # you are successful if you get {"msg":"pong"}
{"msg":"pong"}
```
